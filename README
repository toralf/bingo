=============================================================================
The goal of this project is to find out the differences between the official
proposed odds of the german lottery "Bingo! Die Umweltlotterie" in
http://www.lotto-niedersachsen.de/s/managed_html/536/index.html
and the results calculated by me or published by others.

The surprising result is a (probably not intentionally) cheating of the consumer.
